libirman for Debian
-------------------

 This Debian package is mainly provided so that Irman support can be enabled in
 lirc package and there is no libirman0 because upstream doesn't build a shared
 library.

 If you find it useful for something else and the packaging doesn't meet your
 needs, please file a wishlist bug telling what you want to do with it and why
 you need what you need.
