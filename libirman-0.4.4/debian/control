Description: library for accessing the Irman Infra Red hardware
 libirman is a library that allows access to Irman Infra Red hardware from
 Linux and other Unix systems.
 .
 For general application programming, the preferred interface for infra-red
 control is `lirc', as lirc supports multiple programs sharing the same
 infra-red receiver.  It does this by providing a socket based interface to
 which several programs can connect.
 .
 lirc uses libirman to interface with the Irman Infra Red hardware, so in
 single use applications directly using libirman is simpler and uses less
 system resources.  Currently, lirc only works on Linux systems, so programs
 written using libirman directly are more portable.
 .
 NOTE: This debian package is mainly provided so that Irman support can be
 enabled in lirc package and there is no libirman0 because upstream doesn't
 build a shared library.
