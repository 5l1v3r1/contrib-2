    <h1>About this chapter</h1>
     <!-- Dependencies +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
    <p>
    This chapter describes how to build and install LIRC. Note that LIRC
    is packaged for all major linux distributions. If you
    just want to use lirc, you should be able to install it like any
    other package. This way, you don't have to look at the
    dependencies, build and installation description found here.</p>
    <p>
    The ./configure script is the ultimate source as to what libraries
    and tools LIRC requires. The list here is not complete in any way,
    being focused on things to install before building.</p>

    <a name="dependencies"></a><hr>
    <h1>Dependencies</h1>

    <p>
      <b>Mandatory dependencies</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few mandatory dependencies, all of which
      packaged on most (all?) Linux distributions.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Building directly from the git source tree requires
          <em>autoconf</em>,<em>automake</em> and
          <em>libtool</em>&gt;.</li>
      <li>Compilation and linking requires the GNU toolchain
          including <em>make</em>, <em>gcc</em>, <em>g++</em>
          and <em>ld</em>.</li>
      <li>The build requires python3. If the installed package does
          not provide a python3 link (e. g., just python3.3)
          the <em>--enable-python3-fix</em>  installs a
          wrapper.</li>
      <li>Building without kernel headers is not tested, and might
          cause all sorts of problems. </li>
      <li>xsltproc </li>
     </ul>
     <p><b>Optional dependencies</b></p>
<p>
     If these are missing, ./configure can cope with it and still
     build LIRC in a more or less limited way.
     </p>
<ul>
      <li>Several scripts need the python3 PyYaml package at
          http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML. Building without
          this is possible but not recommended.</li>
      <li>Generating the HTML manpages requires man2html. </li>
      <li>Generating the API documentation requires Doxygen. </li>
      <li>The <em>lirc-setup</em> GUI configuration tool
          needs python3-gi and thus also the Gtk
          libs. These are not required for the build, though. </li>
      <li>Building the X11 GUI tools like <em>irxevent</em> and
          <em>xmode2</em> requires the X11 header files. </li>
      <li> The audio drivers needs the alsa and portaudio libs
           (libraries and headers). </li>
       <li>
          The <em>Irman (=UIR)</em> driver requires libirman available at
         <a href="http://www.lirc.org/software/snapshots/"><em>libirman</em>
         </a>. To build, the irman library must exist as a dynamic .so module.
         At the time of writing this is true for the Fedora package, but
         not for Debian. You can build and install the library locally
         directly from the sources to walk around problems with the
         packaged version. </li>
       <li>
         The <em>ftdi</em> driver requires libftdi from
         <a href="http://www.intra2net.com/de/produkte/opensource/ftdi/">
         http://www.intra2net.com/de/produkte/opensource/ftdi/</a>
</li>
       <li>
         The <em>iguanair</em> driver requires libiguanair from
         <a href="http://iguanaworks.net/ir">http://iguanaworks.net/ir
         </a>
</li>
     </ul>

    <a name="kernel"></a>
    <hr>
    <h1>Kernel</h1>

    <p>
      As of 0.9.0+, lirc uses the kernel modules from the
      kernel. Some of these are formerly lirc modules which are
      now part of the kernel. Thus, building lirc does not involve
      building any kernel modules (as it used to).  </p>
    <p>
      Some of the former lirc modules are part of the official kernel
      and should be available on any reasonably updated system. However,
      some are in the staging area; if they are part of your kernel
      depends on the distro you use (unless of course if you compile
      your own kernel).</p>
    <p>
      There are example and test kernel modules in the drivers/
      directory. None of these are required for regular LIRC use, but
      they are supposed to be helpful while testing or writing drivers.</p>

    <!-- Compiling +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

    <a name="compile"></a><hr>
    <h1>Compile and Install</h1>

    <p>
      Since 0.9.1+ , lirc loads drivers dynamically. This means that
      that the build system is redesigned to always build all drivers.
      The former setup.sh script is dropped in favor of a standard
      ./configure, make, make install sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When building directly from git, a first required step to
      create ./configure and some other files is </p>
<pre>
           ./autogen.sh
</pre>
<p>
      Whether using git sources or just using a distributed tarball, the
      next steps are the canonical
</p>
<pre>
            ./configure
            make
            sudo make install
</pre>
<p>
    Notes:
    </p>
<ul>
      <li>
        When running the configure script, please pay attention at its
        output.  Specifically, at the very end it prints a list of
        the enabled functionality.</li>
      <li>
        Running configure without options will install lirc in /usr/local
        according to GNU standards. However, many examples in this manual
        as well as other documentation are assuming that ./configure ran
        with the <em>--prefix=/usr</em> option, installing in /etc/lirc,
        /usr/bin etc.</li>
      <li>
        The build system supports VPATH builds which does not
        clutter the source tree. To use this do something like:
<pre>
            mkdir _build; cd _build;
            ../configure
            make
            sudo make install
</pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <a name="check"></a><hr>
    <h1>Checking the build</h1>
<p>

     Since the dynamic drivers are not linked during the build, it's
     recommended to check that the expected drivers are built and can
     be loaded using
</p>
<pre>
             cd tools; ./lirc-lsplugins -U ../plugins/.libs
</pre>
     <p>
     This will create a list of the all drivers available, and also
     possible link errors not revealed during the build.
     <em>lirc-lsplugins</em> has a -h option providing help, and
     <em> nroff -man ../doc/man/lirc-lsplugins.1 | more </em>
     provides more complete info.</p>
     <!-- Install LIRC ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

    <a name="configuration"></a><hr>
    <h1>Configuration</h1>

    <p>
      Formerly, lirc was configured during build where the setup.sh script
      was used to select driver, configuration file, etc. Also, there was
      little support for starting and running the services from boot. From
      0.9.1+ the configuration is instead done after the build. The
      configuration steps for the main lircd program involves:
    </p>
<ul>
        <li> In some cases e. g., serial devices setting up kernel module
             options in /etc/modprobe.d. </li>
        <li> Selecting the driver and kernel device for your capture
             device.</li>
        <li> Selecting configuration file for your remote.</li>
        <li> Configuring and using systemd to run the services. </li>
        <li> Creating lircrc files for your applications.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is described in the <a href="configuration-guide.html">
      configuration guide</a>.</p>

    <!-- Uninstall LIRC ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->

    <a name="uninstall"></a><hr>
    <h1>Uninstall</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>Remove the installed artifacts:<br>
        <br>
        <em>make uninstall</em><br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Remove the config files, if you don't need them anymore:<br>
        <br>
        <em>rm -rf /etc/lirc/</em><br>
        <em>rm -f ~/.config/lircrc</em><br>
        <br>
        You might also want to check /etc/modprobe.d for left-overs.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <a name="updating"></a><hr>
    <h1>Updating from older versions</h1>
    <p>
     The <a href="NEWS.txt">NEWS</a> file  describes the changes since last
     version. Normally, upgrading from a previous version should not be too
     painful. However, if you have to update a really old version it's probably
     better to make a fresh install.
